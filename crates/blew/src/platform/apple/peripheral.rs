//! Apple (macOS / iOS) implementation of [`PeripheralBackend`].
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - A dedicated GCD serial queue receives all `CBPeripheralManager` delegate callbacks.
//! - GATT service/characteristic mutable objects are retained so we can push
//!   notifications and respond to read/write requests.
//! - RAII [`ReadResponder`] / [`WriteResponder`] carry ATT responses back to the
//!   CB queue via Tokio oneshot channels + background tasks.
