//! What the Linux peripheral has published, and which power-on it belongs to.
//!
//! Lives outside `platform::linux` so it can be tested on every host, and is
//! generic over the handle types so the tests need no bluer session. In the
//! backend `A` is bluer's `AdvertisementHandle` and `P` its `ApplicationHandle`;
//! dropping either unregisters what it names.
//!
//! The adapter takes the advertisement and GATT application down with it when
//! it powers off, but `start_advertising` refuses while an advertisement handle
//! is held, so a handle kept across the cycle refuses every later start (#46).
//! The generation lives beside the handles so that a start, which awaits BlueZ
//! between publishing and storing, can't store a handle after a power-off.

/// The published handles and the power generation they belong to.
///
/// Every transition is one `&mut self` method, so a caller holding this under
/// one lock acquisition can't observe it half-done. That is the point of
/// [`Published::power_lost`] taking the handles as well as retiring the
/// generation: split across two acquisitions, a start could capture the *new*
/// generation between them, store its GATT application, and have the second
/// half remove it -- leaving an advertisement up with no services behind it.
